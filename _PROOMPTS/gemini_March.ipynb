    "**Core Idea:  Moving from Static HTML to a Dynamic Web Application**\n",
    "\n",
    "Right now, your HTML files are *static*.  They display information, but they don't interact with a database, process user input in a meaningful way, or handle things like user accounts.  FastAPI will provide the *backend* – the \"brain\" that handles all the logic and data, while your HTML/CSS/JavaScript becomes the *frontend* – the user interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where FastAPI Fits In**\n",
    "\n",
    "FastAPI will sit between your frontend (the HTML pages) and your database (currently SQLite, which is a great choice for starting out). Here's how the flow will work:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **User Interaction (Frontend):** A user clicks a button (like \"Login\", \"Sign Up\", \"Upload Paper\"), types in a search query, or interacts with the chat.\n",
    "2.  **Request to FastAPI (Frontend -> Backend):** Your JavaScript code (in `app.js` or other script files) will use the `fetch` API (or a library like Axios) to send a request to a specific *endpoint* that you define in your FastAPI application. This request will often include data (like the user's login credentials, the uploaded file, or the chat message).\n",
    "3.  **FastAPI Processing (Backend):**\n",
    "    *   FastAPI receives the request at the designated endpoint.\n",
    "    *   It performs the necessary logic:\n",
    "        *   **Authentication:**  Verifying usernames/passwords, creating user sessions, etc.\n",
    "        *   **Database Interaction:** Reading data from the `research.db` database (using a library like `databases` or an ORM like SQLAlchemy), inserting new data (like uploaded papers), updating data, or deleting data.\n",
    "        *   **AI Processing:**  This is where you'd integrate any AI models for summarizing papers, generating podcasts, or handling the chat functionality.  This could involve calling external APIs (like OpenAI's API) or running your own models.\n",
    "        *   **Data Validation:** FastAPI's biggest strengths. It uses Pydantic to ensure that the data you receive from the frontend is in the correct format, and automatically generates interactive API documentation.\n",
    "    *   FastAPI constructs a *response*.  This is usually JSON data, containing the results of the operation (e.g., a success/failure message, the requested data from the database, the summary of a paper, etc.).\n",
    "4.  **Response to Frontend (Backend -> Frontend):** FastAPI sends the JSON response back to the frontend.\n",
    "5.  **Frontend Updates (Frontend):** Your JavaScript code receives the response.  It then updates the HTML page dynamically, without requiring a full page reload.  This is how you'll display the results of a search, show a success message after a login, add new chat messages to the chat window, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Specific FastAPI Endpoints and Functionality**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of potential FastAPI endpoints, aligned with the features in your HTML, and how they would connect:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. User Authentication (Login/Signup)**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`/users/register` (POST):**\n",
    "    *   **Purpose:**  Create a new user account.\n",
    "    *   **Request Body:**  `{ \"username\": \"...\", \"email\": \"...\", \"password\": \"...\" }` (using Pydantic for validation)\n",
    "    *   **Backend Logic:**\n",
    "        *   Hash the password (using a library like `passlib`) for security.  *Never* store passwords in plain text.\n",
    "        *   Check if the username/email already exists in the database.\n",
    "        *   If not, insert a new user record into the database.\n",
    "        *   Return a success message or an error message (e.g., \"Username already taken\").\n",
    "    *   **Frontend Connection:**  The \"Sign Up\" buttons would trigger a `fetch` request to this endpoint, sending the form data.\n",
    "*   **`/users/login` (POST):**\n",
    "    *   **Purpose:** Authenticate an existing user.\n",
    "    *   **Request Body:**  `{ \"username\": \"...\", \"password\": \"...\" }`\n",
    "    *   **Backend Logic:**\n",
    "        *   Retrieve the user's hashed password from the database.\n",
    "        *   Compare the provided password (hashed) with the stored hashed password.\n",
    "        *   If successful, create a session (using a library like `itsdangerous` or a more robust solution like JWT - JSON Web Tokens). Store a session ID in a cookie.\n",
    "        *   Return a success message and potentially user data (username, etc.).\n",
    "    *   **Frontend Connection:**  The \"Login\" buttons would trigger a `fetch` request to this endpoint.  On success, the frontend would store the session ID and redirect the user to the homepage (`homepage.html`).\n",
    "*   **`/users/me` (GET):**\n",
    "    *    **Purpose:** Fetch the data of the currently logged in user.\n",
    "    *    **Authentication:**  Requires a valid session ID (from the cookie).\n",
    "    *    **Backend Logic:**\n",
    "        *    Retrieve the user's data from the database based on the session ID.\n",
    "        *    Return the user's data (e.g., username, email, etc.).  *Don't* return the password!\n",
    "    *    **Frontend Connection:**  Used on the `homepage.html` to display the user's name (\"WELCOME BACK, RAGHAV\").  This would be called after a successful login.\n",
    "*    `/users/logout` (POST):**\n",
    "    * Purpose: Invalidate the current user session.\n",
    "    * Backend Logic: Remove or expire the session ID associated with the user.\n",
    "    * Frontend Connection: This would require adding a \"Logout\" button, probably to `homepage.html`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Paper Management (Homepage)**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`/papers` (GET):**\n",
    "    *   **Purpose:**  Retrieve a list of papers (for the homepage).\n",

    "        *   `limit`:  The number of papers to return (for pagination).\n",
    "        *   `offset`:  The starting point for pagination.  (e.g., `limit=10&offset=20` would get papers 21-30).\n",
    "        *   `search`: A search term to filter papers by title or description.\n",
    "    *   **Backend Logic:**\n",
    "        *   Query the `newsletter` table in your database.  Use `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` for pagination.  Use `WHERE` clauses for searching.\n",
    "        *   Return a list of paper data (e.g., `[{\"summary_id\": 1, \"title\": \"...\", \"picture\": \"...\", \"description\": \"...\"}]`).\n",
    "    *   **Frontend Connection:**  Your `fetchAndDisplayPapers` function in `homepage.html` would be modified to:\n",
    "        *   Make a `fetch` request to `/papers`.\n",
    "        *   Use the returned JSON data to dynamically create the `paper-card` elements.\n",
    "        *   The \"Load More\" button would make another request to `/papers` with an incremented `offset`.\n",
    "*   **`/papers/{paper_id}` (GET):**\n",
    "    *   **Purpose:** Retrieve the full details of a single paper.\n",
    "    *   **Path Parameter:** `paper_id` (e.g., `/papers/1`).\n",
    "    *   **Backend Logic:**\n",
    "        *   Query the database for the paper with the given `summary_id`.\n",
    "        *   Return the paper's data (title, picture, content).\n",
    "    *   **Frontend Connection:**  Your `content_page.html` would be modified to:\n",
    "        *   Extract the `paper_id` from the URL (you'd likely use JavaScript's `URLSearchParams`).\n",
    "        *   Make a `fetch` request to `/papers/{paper_id}`.\n",
    "        *   Use the returned JSON data to populate the page content.\n",
    "*   **`/papers/upload` (POST):**\n",
    "    *   **Purpose:**  Handle paper uploads.\n",
    "    *   **Request Body:**  This is more complex. You'll likely use `FormData` in your JavaScript and FastAPI's `UploadFile` to handle file uploads.\n",
    "    *   **Backend Logic:**\n",
    "        *   Save the uploaded file to a secure location (e.g., a dedicated \"uploads\" directory). *Don't* store files directly in the database.\n",
    "        *   Optionally, process the file (e.g., extract text using a library like `PyPDF2` if it's a PDF).\n",
    "        *   Store metadata about the file (filename, upload date, user ID, etc.) in the database.\n",
    "        *   Potentially trigger the AI summarization process.\n",
    "    *   **Frontend Connection:** The \"Upload Paper\" button and the dropzone would trigger a `fetch` request to this endpoint.\n",

    "EXPLAIN ME ALL OF THIS CONCEPTUALLY SINCE I AM NEW TO FAST API. HOW WOULD I EVEN IMPLEMENT ALL OF THIS?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Idea:  Moving from Static HTML to a Dynamic Web Application**\n",
    "\n",
    "Right now, your HTML files are *static*.  They display information, but they don't interact with a database, process user input in a meaningful way, or handle things like user accounts.  FastAPI will provide the *backend* – the \"brain\" that handles all the logic and data, while your HTML/CSS/JavaScript becomes the *frontend* – the user interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where FastAPI Fits In**\n",
    "\n",
    "FastAPI will sit between your frontend (the HTML pages) and your database (currently SQLite, which is a great choice for starting out). Here's how the flow will work:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **User Interaction (Frontend):** A user clicks a button (like \"Login\", \"Sign Up\", \"Upload Paper\"), types in a search query, or interacts with the chat.\n",
    "2.  **Request to FastAPI (Frontend -> Backend):** Your JavaScript code (in `app.js` or other script files) will use the `fetch` API (or a library like Axios) to send a request to a specific *endpoint* that you define in your FastAPI application. This request will often include data (like the user's login credentials, the uploaded file, or the chat message).\n",
    "3.  **FastAPI Processing (Backend):**\n",
    "    *   FastAPI receives the request at the designated endpoint.\n",
    "    *   It performs the necessary logic:\n",
    "        *   **Authentication:**  Verifying usernames/passwords, creating user sessions, etc.\n",
    "        *   **Database Interaction:** Reading data from the `research.db` database (using a library like `databases` or an ORM like SQLAlchemy), inserting new data (like uploaded papers), updating data, or deleting data.\n",
    "        *   **AI Processing:**  This is where you'd integrate any AI models for summarizing papers, generating podcasts, or handling the chat functionality.  This could involve calling external APIs (like OpenAI's API) or running your own models.\n",
    "        *   **Data Validation:** FastAPI's biggest strengths. It uses Pydantic to ensure that the data you receive from the frontend is in the correct format, and automatically generates interactive API documentation.\n",
    "    *   FastAPI constructs a *response*.  This is usually JSON data, containing the results of the operation (e.g., a success/failure message, the requested data from the database, the summary of a paper, etc.).\n",
    "4.  **Response to Frontend (Backend -> Frontend):** FastAPI sends the JSON response back to the frontend.\n",
    "5.  **Frontend Updates (Frontend):** Your JavaScript code receives the response.  It then updates the HTML page dynamically, without requiring a full page reload.  This is how you'll display the results of a search, show a success message after a login, add new chat messages to the chat window, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Specific FastAPI Endpoints and Functionality**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of potential FastAPI endpoints, aligned with the features in your HTML, and how they would connect:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. User Authentication (Login/Signup)**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`/users/register` (POST):**\n",
    "    *   **Purpose:**  Create a new user account.\n",
    "    *   **Request Body:**  `{ \"username\": \"...\", \"email\": \"...\", \"password\": \"...\" }` (using Pydantic for validation)\n",
    "    *   **Backend Logic:**\n",
    "        *   Hash the password (using a library like `passlib`) for security.  *Never* store passwords in plain text.\n",
    "        *   Check if the username/email already exists in the database.\n",
    "        *   If not, insert a new user record into the database.\n",
    "        *   Return a success message or an error message (e.g., \"Username already taken\").\n",
    "    *   **Frontend Connection:**  The \"Sign Up\" buttons would trigger a `fetch` request to this endpoint, sending the form data.\n",
    "*   **`/users/login` (POST):**\n",
    "    *   **Purpose:** Authenticate an existing user.\n",
    "    *   **Request Body:**  `{ \"username\": \"...\", \"password\": \"...\" }`\n",
    "    *   **Backend Logic:**\n",
    "        *   Retrieve the user's hashed password from the database.\n",
    "        *   Compare the provided password (hashed) with the stored hashed password.\n",
    "        *   If successful, create a session (using a library like `itsdangerous` or a more robust solution like JWT - JSON Web Tokens). Store a session ID in a cookie.\n",
    "        *   Return a success message and potentially user data (username, etc.).\n",
    "    *   **Frontend Connection:**  The \"Login\" buttons would trigger a `fetch` request to this endpoint.  On success, the frontend would store the session ID and redirect the user to the homepage (`homepage.html`).\n",
    "*   **`/users/me` (GET):**\n",
    "    *    **Purpose:** Fetch the data of the currently logged in user.\n",
    "    *    **Authentication:**  Requires a valid session ID (from the cookie).\n",
    "    *    **Backend Logic:**\n",
    "        *    Retrieve the user's data from the database based on the session ID.\n",
    "        *    Return the user's data (e.g., username, email, etc.).  *Don't* return the password!\n",
    "    *    **Frontend Connection:**  Used on the `homepage.html` to display the user's name (\"WELCOME BACK, RAGHAV\").  This would be called after a successful login.\n",
    "*    `/users/logout` (POST):**\n",
    "    * Purpose: Invalidate the current user session.\n",
    "    * Backend Logic: Remove or expire the session ID associated with the user.\n",
    "    * Frontend Connection: This would require adding a \"Logout\" button, probably to `homepage.html`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Paper Management (Homepage)**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`/papers` (GET):**\n",
    "    *   **Purpose:**  Retrieve a list of papers (for the homepage).\n",
    "    *   **Query Parameters (optional):**\n",
    "        *   `limit`:  The number of papers to return (for pagination).\n",
    "        *   `offset`:  The starting point for pagination.  (e.g., `limit=10&offset=20` would get papers 21-30).\n",
    "        *   `search`: A search term to filter papers by title or description.\n",
    "    *   **Backend Logic:**\n",
    "        *   Query the `newsletter` table in your database.  Use `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` for pagination.  Use `WHERE` clauses for searching.\n",
    "        *   Return a list of paper data (e.g., `[{\"summary_id\": 1, \"title\": \"...\", \"picture\": \"...\", \"description\": \"...\"}]`).\n",
    "    *   **Frontend Connection:**  Your `fetchAndDisplayPapers` function in `homepage.html` would be modified to:\n",
    "        *   Make a `fetch` request to `/papers`.\n",
    "        *   Use the returned JSON data to dynamically create the `paper-card` elements.\n",
    "        *   The \"Load More\" button would make another request to `/papers` with an incremented `offset`.\n",
    "*   **`/papers/{paper_id}` (GET):**\n",
    "    *   **Purpose:** Retrieve the full details of a single paper.\n",
    "    *   **Path Parameter:** `paper_id` (e.g., `/papers/1`).\n",
    "    *   **Backend Logic:**\n",
    "        *   Query the database for the paper with the given `summary_id`.\n",
    "        *   Return the paper's data (title, picture, content).\n",
    "    *   **Frontend Connection:**  Your `content_page.html` would be modified to:\n",
    "        *   Extract the `paper_id` from the URL (you'd likely use JavaScript's `URLSearchParams`).\n",
    "        *   Make a `fetch` request to `/papers/{paper_id}`.\n",
    "        *   Use the returned JSON data to populate the page content.\n",
    "*   **`/papers/upload` (POST):**\n",
    "    *   **Purpose:**  Handle paper uploads.\n",
    "    *   **Request Body:**  This is more complex. You'll likely use `FormData` in your JavaScript and FastAPI's `UploadFile` to handle file uploads.\n",
    "    *   **Backend Logic:**\n",
    "        *   Save the uploaded file to a secure location (e.g., a dedicated \"uploads\" directory). *Don't* store files directly in the database.\n",
    "        *   Optionally, process the file (e.g., extract text using a library like `PyPDF2` if it's a PDF).\n",
    "        *   Store metadata about the file (filename, upload date, user ID, etc.) in the database.\n",
    "        *   Potentially trigger the AI summarization process.\n",
    "    *   **Frontend Connection:** The \"Upload Paper\" button and the dropzone would trigger a `fetch` request to this endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. AI Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`/papers/{paper_id}/summary` (GET):**\n",
    "    *   **Purpose:** Get an AI-generated summary of a paper.\n",
    "    *   **Backend Logic:**\n",
    "        *   If the summary already exists in the database, return it.\n",
    "        *   If not, call your AI summarization logic (external API or local model).\n",
    "        *   Store the generated summary in the database for future use (caching).\n",
    "        *   Return the summary.\n",
    "*   **`/papers/{paper_id}/podcast` (GET):**\n",
    "    *   **Purpose:** Get an AI-generated podcast URL for a paper.\n",
    "    *   **Backend Logic:**\n",
    "        *   Similar to the summary, check if it exists; if not, generate it (using a text-to-speech API, likely). Store the URL in the database. Return the URL.\n",
    "*   **`/papers/{paper_id}/chat` (POST):**\n",
    "    *   **Purpose:** Handle chat interactions with a paper.\n",
    "    *   **Request Body:** `{ \"message\": \"User's question\" }`\n",
    "    *   **Backend Logic:**\n",
    "        *   Use the `paper_id` to identify the context.\n",
    "        *   Send the user's message to your AI chat model (external API or local model).\n",
    "        *   Return the AI's response.\n",
    "    *   **Frontend Connection:**  The chat input in `content_page.html` would send a `fetch` request to this endpoint on each message submission.  The frontend would then display the returned AI response.'''\n",
