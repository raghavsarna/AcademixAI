PROMPT: Give me code to solve the problem 'rainwater trapping'
NOTES: Rainwater Trapping

RESPONSE:

--- CODE START ---
def trap(height):
  if not height:
    return 0

  # Find the maximum height of the bars
  max_height = max(height)

  # Initialize the total amount of water trapped
  total_water = 0

  # Iterate over the bars
  for i in range(len(height)):
    # Calculate the amount of water trapped at the current bar
    water_trapped = max_height - height[i]

    # Add the water trapped at the current bar to the total amount of water trapped
    total_water += water_trapped

  # Return the total amount of water trapped
  return total_water
--- CODE END ---
