RESPONSE:

The provided factorial function cannot be modified to handle negative numbers because factorials are only defined for non-negative integers. Attempting to calculate the factorial of a negative number results in a complex number, which is beyond the scope of the factorial function.

Here's an explanation:

- The factorial of a number n, denoted as n!, is defined as the product of all positive integers from 1 to n. For example, 5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120.

- Extending this definition to negative numbers would require using complex numbers, which introduce a level of mathematical complexity that is not appropriate for the factorial function's intended purpose.

- In mathematics, the factorial function is often denoted as Î“(z), where z is a complex number. This generalized factorial function can handle complex inputs, but it is a more advanced concept that is not suitable for a basic factorial function implementation.

Therefore, it is not advisable to modify the factorial function to handle negative numbers. Instead, it is more appropriate to raise an error or return a special value (e.g., -1) when a negative number is provided as input.
